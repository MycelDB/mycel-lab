# one-node-graph-smoke

## Purpose

Single-node graph transaction smoke scenario.

This document explains the scenario intent, runtime topology, tunable parameters, and evidence to inspect when the test passes or fails.

## Topology

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  actor0["graph-writers actors"] --> entry["Mycel endpoint"]
  entry --> svc["myceld-client Service"]
  svc --> pod0["myceld-0 Pod"]
```

## Scenario phases

1. **smoke**. Duration: `1s`.

## Actors

| Actor group | Profile | Count | Rate knobs |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `graph-writers` | `graph-committer` | `1` | commitsPerSecond=10 |

## Tunable parameters

| Parameter | Default/source | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `seed` | `8080` | Reproducible scheduling and actor randomness. |
| `environment.driver` | `k3d` | Selects the environment driver used by the scenario. |
| `environment.namespace` | `mycel-lab` | Kubernetes namespace or logical environment scope. |
| `clusterRef` | `single-node` | Cluster profile used as the base topology. |
| `actorGroups[].count` | YAML actor group values | Number of concurrent actors per group. |
| `actorGroups[].rate` | YAML actor group rates | Workload throughput for commit/query actors. |
| `phases[].duration` | YAML phase durations | How long each workload/disruption phase runs. |

## Evidence and artifacts

- `result.json` records phase status and terminal pass/fail state.
- `events.jsonl` records phase events, disruption operations, and correctness failures.
- `summary.md` gives a human-readable run summary.
- `resolved-scenario.json` captures the fully resolved scenario, including profile overrides.
- Environment-specific captures under `environment/` show Kubernetes/Compose state, logs, and endpoints when enabled.

## Common failure modes

- Environment setup failures usually indicate missing local prerequisites or stale Kubernetes/Compose resources.
- Actor failures usually indicate data-plane, authentication, or endpoint-routing issues.
- Final assertion failures should be debugged with `events.jsonl`, `oracle/`, and environment captures before rerunning.
- For destructive scenarios, confirm the namespace/project is disposable before using `--confirm-destructive`.
